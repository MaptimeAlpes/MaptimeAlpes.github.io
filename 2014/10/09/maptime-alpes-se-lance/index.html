<p>Everyone is welcome, from seasoned geo-professionals, to fresh beginners - this is a place to learn, teach and share your enthusiasm for (and knowledge of) maps, mapmaking and all things geo. 
We will be talking about what we want Maptime-Alpes to be - this is a place for you, after all - so we want to know WHAT you want to learn, WHAT you want to share, WHAT you think is awesome. </p>
