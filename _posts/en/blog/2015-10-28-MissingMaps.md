##Maptime-Alpes + Missing Maps Mapathon
First missingmaps mapathon in Grenoble!
<!--more-->
Although the goal was to contribute to #missingmaps tasks in the [HotOSM](http://tasks.hotosm.org/) task manager, we changed course to map population zones and roads in Afghanistan, in light of the recent earthquake there.

A small group of die-hard mappers showed up, despite the atrocious weather we were experiencing.

Yet again, we would like to thank the [local OSM](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Grenoble_groupe_local) group who showed up to make sure we had all the help we needed with respect to the OpenStreetMap tools (JOSM in particular).

Martin et Maeve of [CartONG](http://www.cartong.org/) also came down from Chamb√©ry to offer support and to do some mapping themselves.  

Thanks to all the mappers who showed up - if you weren't able to attend, worry not, we will be doing more mapathons in the future!
