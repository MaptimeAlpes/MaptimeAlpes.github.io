####First meeting was a success - next meeting announced!
We had our first meeting on Tuesday, and had a great turnout of 11 people - not bad for a first effort!
<!--more-->

We talked about why each of us is interested in Maptime, and what we would like to learn in future meetings. A couple topics people mentioned were [d3](htttp://www.d3js.com) and [TileMill](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill).

We also watched a presentation called [Anatomy of a web map](http://www.maptime.io/anatomy-of-a-web-map) in which we learned about the components of a web map, and some of the tools and data people can use in web maps.

The next meeting will be on Tuesday, November 25th, and we will be doing a workshop on [TileMill](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill). More details coming soon!
