##Leaflet Introduction
After reboot, a webmap presentation, Leaflet is coming back for a new session.
<!--more-->
The presentation is [on line](http://tsamaya.github.io/leaflet-intro/).

During this presentation we follow the quick start from website [leafletjs](http://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start.html).

Then we added [geojson](http://leafletjs.com/examples/geojson.html) data on the map, ending using two plugins [heat](http://leaflet.github.io/Leaflet.heat/demo/) and [marckercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster).

It was my last session at maptime for a long time, so I added my contacts in the presentation.

We ended the session in a Pub nearby.
