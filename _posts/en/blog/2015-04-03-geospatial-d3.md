####D3js does maps!
After the great presentation on [d3js for spatio-temporal visualizations](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeAlpes/events/221185352/), we wanted to keep the momentum going and dive in with a hands-on d3 workshop. Since this is Maptime-Alpes, not Charttime-Alpes, we focused primarily on the geographic capabilities of d3.

Never ones to shy away from help, we borrowed heavily from [MaptimeSea](http://maptimesea.github.io/2015/01/07/d3-mapping.html) and [maori.geek](http://www.maori.geek.nz/post/d3_js_geo_fun), as they had both done some great work on making d3 geospatial _accessible_, which is one of the primary hurdles in d3.

We did a review on the d3 components: Documents, Data, & Driven (by data), and then dove in with a simple [tutorial]({% post_url en/tuts/2015-04-02-d3-geospatial %}) and left time at the end to try and do some challenges to expand on what we had just learned.

Check out the [tutorial]({% post_url en/tuts/2015-04-02-d3-geospatial %}) if you weren't able to attend the meeting, and see you [next meeting](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeAlpes/events/222128203/) for OSM humaritarian mapping!
