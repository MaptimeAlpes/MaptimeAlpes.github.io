####LeafletJS
For this recent event, a dozen people showed up to have some fun with a [LeafletJS](http://leafletjs.com/) workshop!
After a nice overview of concepts behind Web Mapping and Leaflet.js, from the basics of webmaps to Leaflet.js integration and development, it was time for us to get down to business and start to code.
<!--more-->

We covered the following topics :

- How to initialize a map with a nice basemap
- How to add a simple marker on the map and show a popup on click. 
- Then how to change the basemap from a list.

We had also prepared two challenges for the quicker developers:

- build a San Franciso crime map with a geojson feed, 
- and a earthquakes heatmap with another geojson feed.

The slides are [online](http://maptime-alpes.com/leaflet-first-webmap) in french. 

Sources files are available on [github](https://github.com/MaptimeAlpes/leaflet-first-webmap).

Next month another workshop for you and your friends! Keep a eye on [MeetUp](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeAlpes/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaptimeAlpes) for more details.
