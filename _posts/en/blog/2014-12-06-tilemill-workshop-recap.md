####Cuttin' tiles with TileMill!
A half-dozen folks come out for our [TileMill](http://www.mapbox.com/tilemill) workshop during our November meeting. We learned the ins and outs of TileMill from data loading to interactive features. 
<!--more-->

TileMill is a great program for making web-map tiles, or even for making beautiful exported images. We learned how to:

* upload a CSV containing lat/long columns to point data
* style points and polygons with the excellent [CartCSS](https://www.mapbox.com/tilemill/docs/manual/carto/) style language
* add interactive tooltips to access the data behind the tiles
* add legends to explain what we are displaying
* export our maps to .mbtiles and .png/.pdf formats

The next maptime-alpes is going to be a [Leaflet.js](http://leafletjs.com/) workshop - so be prepared to create awesome maps using javascript! With the holiday season's tight scheduling, our next meeting will be at the end of January, date and location TBA. Keep an eye out at [Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeAlpes/) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MaptimeAlpes).
