####OSM crisis mapping for Nepal
Maptime HQ called: [Calling all troops! Help HOT](http://maptime.io/blog/2015/04/27/help-HOT/), and on Tuesday  May, 5th, we answered with a [Maphathon](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeAlpes/events/222128203/) to support humanitarian efforts in Nepal.

To help OSM newbies get up to speed, local [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) folks taught the basics of [JOSM](https://josm.openstreetmap.de/), the primary OSM data editing tool. Then [Adam](https://github.com/abenrob) introduced [HOT](http://hotosm.org/) (the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team) and in particular the HOT task manager.

Pizzas were offered by [ESRI France](http://www.esrifrance.fr/) which helped folks stay the course.

Our primary task was [task 1018](http://tasks.hotosm.org/project/1018) in Nepal. Beginner mappers were aided and guided by several expert mappers, and were able to digitize roads, paths, buildings and waterways to help emergency rescuers on the ground in Nepal.
