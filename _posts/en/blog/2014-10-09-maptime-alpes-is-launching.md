####Busy later this month?
Come help launch Maptime-Alpes, the Rh√¥ne-Alpes chapter of [Maptime.io](http://www.maptime.io)! We will be meeting here in Grenoble at 7pm on October 28th, at [co-work](http://www.co-work.fr).
<!--more-->

Everyone is welcome, from seasoned geo-professionals, to fresh beginners - this is a place to learn, teach and share your enthusiasm for (and knowledge of) maps, mapmaking and all things geo. 
We will be talking about what we want Maptime-Alpes to be - this is a place for you, after all - so we want to know WHAT you want to learn, WHAT you want to share, WHAT you think is awesome. We'll also be doing a presentaition on what makes a web-map function, and it's really neat!

You can sign-up with [meetup](http://www.meetup.com/MaptimeAlpes/) or simply drop in.
