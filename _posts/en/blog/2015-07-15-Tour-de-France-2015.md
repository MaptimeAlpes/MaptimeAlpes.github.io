####Tour de France 2015
As it is the beginning of the Tour de France, we had the idea to make and share several maps of the route of this year's Tour.
<!--more-->
We found this year's route data in GPX format, which is the standard format of recreatoion-grade GPS receivers. The Github repo [tour-de-france-2015](https://github.com/MaptimeAlpes/tour-de-france-2015) contains the stages in different formats. The data were sourced from [MapMyTracks](http://www.mapmytracks.com/), and as the 'official' route was not yet posted on their site, we used that of the [tour -de-force](https://www.mapmytracks.com/events/tour-de-force-2015) which mimics the official route as much as is possible.

Adam, Laurent and Arnaud each put together a little bit of javascript to show their approach for visualising the stages.

- Adam used [Tom McWright's](https://github.com/tmcw) [running-map-example](https://github.com/mapbox/running-map-example) as a starting point. Check out his Tour de France version here: [tdf-maptime](http://abenrob.com/tdf-maptime/#1)

- Arnaud used leaflet GPX and elevation profile plugins to present his version:  [gpx-and-elevation](http://maptime-alpes.com/tour-de-france-2015/visu/gpx-and-elevation/)

- Laurent dressed up his visualisation with information about each stage:  [gpx-elevation-and-custom-js](http://maptime-alpes.com/tour-de-france-2015/visu/gpx-elevation-and-custom-js/)

One of the goals of the workshop was to take the data we had found, and try them out using different tools. Three of the tools we set out to use were:

- [cartodb](https://cartodb.com/) with [odyssey](http://cartodb.github.io/odyssey.js/)

- [arcgis](http://arcgis.com) with [storymaps](http://storymaps.arcgis.com/)

- [umap](umap.openstreetmap.fr)

#### CartoDB
Adam started working with cartodb/odyssey. His concustion was that this combo was not really ready for primetime - cartodb is solid, but the integration with odyssey was demonstrative at best.

#### Storymaps
Arnaud built his first storymap using arcgis.com, with the following results: [http://arcg.is/1glDZs1](http://arcg.is/1glDZs1). Though it is not necessary to have a paid account to make a storymap, or to explore the possibilities of the arcgis.com platform, creating a developer account does allow you 50 credits a month to leverage against paid features of the platform. Developer accounts can be created at  [developers.arcgis.com](https://developers.arcgis.com)

To start an app using the same data, you can find the uploaded data  [here](http://d8esrifrance.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=2bb274896a75435286e1e27f143a2718)

####uMap
Without Guillaume's presence, we lacked a verifiable uMap pro... We decided to hold off on uMap until a future workshop.

#### Various
Thomas found an interesting application which allows one to load GPX data and follow the route in 3d. Check it out [http://www.doarama.com/](http://www.doarama.com/)

Jérôme showed some of his work on a bicycle route sharing app. Really nice example of French R&D!

####The winner's cup
We celebrated our Tour victory with pints at a local pub...
Next month, we'll be focusing on planning out the things we want to learn over the next year of #maptime.
